    <h3>Parameters specified as nested elements</h3>

    <h4>s3:client</h4>

    <p><a href="s3client.html">s3:client</a> to use for deletion. If a client is
    specified either in this manner or by use of <code>@clientrefid</code>, the
    <code>delete</code> operation is put into batch mode. If the collection of
    <code>s3:object</code> resources come from an
    <a href="s3objects.html">s3:objects</a> collection, and therefore already
    have a reference to the client that discovered them, this task does not need
    a client reference and each object will be requested to delete itself.
    </p>

    <h4>resource collection</h4>

    <p>Any number of nested resource collections may be specified; however
    resources other than <a href="s3object.html">s3:object</a> are ignored.
    Further, if <code>@as</code> is <code>object</code> an <code>s3:object</code>
    that is a delete marker will also be ignored, as it indicates the object
    has already been deleted, so far as it goes.</p>
